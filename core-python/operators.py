# Arithmetic and assignment

# a = 5
# b = 3

# Arithmetic : addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modules

# print(a + b)
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)


# it returns remainder
# print(b % a)

# floor division

# print(a // b)

# 1.6 : 1
# 2.3 : 2
# 3.5 : 3

# assignment operators help to assign a new value to the variable

x = 10
x += 5 # x = x + 5
# x -= 5 # x = x - 5
# x *= 5
# x /= 5

# assignment operator
x = 10
# print(x)
