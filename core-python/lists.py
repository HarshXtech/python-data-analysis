country = ["india", "usa", "ireland", "ausis"]

marks = [10,20,30]

# this will return 0th element of the list 

# country[0] = "Japan"
# print(country)

# manupilate lists. 

# append : will add en element 
# country.append("UK")
# print(country)


# sort in ascending and descending order
# country.sort() # a to z
# country.reverse() # z to a
# print(country)

# remove : it removes given element
# country.remove('ireland')
# print(country)

# pop : removes last element
# country.pop()
# print(country)

# index : it will find the index number of the given value!
# print(country.index("ireland"))

# a = list('abcde')
